<h2>Why you should use OnionWallet:</h2>
Bitcoin and Bitcoin wallets itself are not really anonymous, they only 
provide so called pseudonymity, which means as long as no one knows 
which Bitcoin addresses you are using, you are anonymous.<br>
That anonymity is easily destroyed when you deal with some party that 
knows your real identity, for example if you sell or buy bitcoins on an 
exchange.<br>
And with more and more exchanges and other services following AML and 
KYC policies, its getting really hard to stay anonymous to government 
agencys when dealing with bitcoins.<br>
OnionWallet helps you break that chain, since its hosted at a Tor hidden
 service, and no one knows who we are, we do not have to follow any AML 
and KYC policies, so we cannot be forced to give out any of our users 
information.<br>
Even if we wanted to, we do not have much information about our users 
since through tor we do not see any ips or other sensitive data.<br>
OnionWallet mixes all bitcoins, which makes tracing you on the Bitcoin blockchain impossible.<br>
<br>
<h2>Bitcoin and Tor, a perfect team</h2>
When using Bitcoin together with Tor you are combining the best online 
money with the best encryption and privacy technology available.<br>
Its simply not possible to know you are not under surveillance when using normal internet websites for managing your Bitcoins.<br>
Only a shared Bitcoin Web Wallet hosted as a Tor hidden service will provide you maximum anonymity and privacy!<br>
<br>
<h2>Free Bitcoin Laundry, Bitcoin Washing, Bitcoin Mixer</h2>
Launder your Bitcoins without any fees, all we charge is the network fee we pay to bitcoins miners.<br>
For mixing your Bitcoins, or washing them, it is best to use a Tor 
hidden service like OnionWallet because all mixers operating a clearnet 
website, including coinfog, are subject to government control.<br>
